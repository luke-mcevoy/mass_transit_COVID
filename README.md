Mass Transit algorithm that optimized distance between passengers using seat assignment

# Problem
Carriers are burning through between $10 and $12 billion a month due to travel halt. National average of roughly one passenger for every 20 seats on Airlines. There is no lack of legislation in regards to a mass transit passenger placement safety protocol. Currently, passenger safety is up to discretion of the flight attendant and digital selection of seats when purchasing a ticket. The CDC, WHO, TSA, and Airlines for America can fill this gap with by using an algorithm such as this.

# Solution
Using input of rows, columns, and passengers, the algorithm can determine the optimal passenger placement.

# How to use
run main.py with gateway.py and algorithms.py in the same directory.

# Troubles / Bugs
I had trouble dealing with handling and merging 2D arrays. Furthermore, in its current state, the algorithm has flaws with dynamically adjusting to extra rows.

# Future Improvements
I look to update the algorithm using shortest path/graph theory algorithms such as Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm. Moreover, when I began the project, I knew graph theory and dynamic programming would be a better route to a solution but am excited to work towards their implantation after the HealthHack.
